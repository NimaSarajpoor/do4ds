# Introduction

If you want to do serious data science, you've got to deploy. This book can help you figure out how to DIY it or how to work with your org's IT/DevOps/SysAdmin/SRE group to make that happen.

What is the role of Data Science in orgs?
Generation of insights or applications to provide insights based on data.
Data Science vs BI vs Analytics -- it’s all fuzzy
Data Visualization and Machine Learning are a means, not an ends.
Role in org varies widely -- and therefore IT requirements are hard to predict.
As data science becomes more central to org’s value generation, data science is increasingly being done in centralized platforms.
What is the open data science platform: A centralized location to manage data science dev environment, as well as test and deploy content to end-users.
Comparison to decentralized “work on your own machine” situations.
