# Preface {-}

At some point, most data scientists reach the point where they want to show their work to others. But the skills and tools to deploy data science are  completely different from the skills and tools needed to do data science.

This book aims to help demystify the process of deploying data science, whether you're building a DIY deployment system or trying to work with your organization's IT/DevOps/SysAdmin/SRE group to make that happen.

If you want to do serious data science, you've got to deploy. This book can help you figure out how to DIY it or how to work with your org's IT/DevOps/SysAdmin/SRE group to make that happen.

## Software information and conventions {-}

I used the **knitr**\index{knitr} package [@xie2015] and the **bookdown**\index{bookdown} package [@R-bookdown] to compile my book. My R session information is shown below:

```{r}
xfun::session_info()
```

Package names are in bold text (e.g., **rmarkdown**), and inline code and filenames are formatted in a typewriter font (e.g., `knitr::knit('foo.Rmd')`). Function names are followed by parentheses (e.g., `bookdown::render_book()`).

## Acknowledgments {-}

A lot of people are helping me write this book.

This book is published to the web using GitHub Actions from [rOpenSci](https://github.com/orchid00/actions_sandbox).
