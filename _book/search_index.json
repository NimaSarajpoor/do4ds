Generation of insights or applications to provide insights based on data. Data Science vs BI vs Analytics – it’s all fuzzy Data Visualization and Machine Learning are a means, not an ends. Role in org varies widely – and therefore IT requirements are hard to predict. As data science becomes more central to org’s value generation, data science is increasingly being done in centralized platforms. What is the open data science platform: A centralized location to manage data science dev environment, as well as test and deploy content to end-users. Comparison to decentralized “work on your own machine” situations. Components Workbench Package Management Change Control (git) Deployment Environment Front End vs Back End Data Ingest/Access Determining Requirements for your platform Platform requirements combination of Work being done on the platform Data Science needs (i.e. horsepower) Existing state of org’s data Type of work data scientists might do Batch Jobs ETL Reports Data Generation Real-Time Interactive Models APIs Apps Data Science + IT Needs Languages (R, Python, SQL) Sharing – internal, external Online or offline?

Computer yuo don’t own Just the computer itself Usually don’t have access to it the way you do to local machine Usually login to access the command line on that machine using SSH Purpose is to serve things – to other machines via APIs or people via browser [Diagram: 3 ways of accessing servers] 2.2 What is the Cloud? General description for servers that you rent instead of buy 3 major cloud providers Services: Compute Storage Database Networking MANY MANY MANY layers on top of that 2.3 What does networking mean? How you know where to access a server Lots of layers, but controls access to the servers doors Different from authentication, which determines who gets let into doors 2.4 How is a server different from my laptop? [maybe make a table?] OS How you access 2.5 How can I get my very own server? Cloud free tiers Walk through creating account, logging in, getting EC2 set up Access using PEM key (point to SSH chapter) 2.6 Exercises: Consider a simple data science app that allows an end user to view data. Can you draw a diagram of how that app could be deployed on remote servers? Where could the data live? How would users access the app? How would you access the app to do maintenance?

Stand up a new server on one of the major cloud providers. Try logging in using the provided key file. Create a new user on the server. Generate a new SSH key locally and copy the correct key onto the server (think for a moment about which key is the correct one – consult your diagram from step 1 if necessary). Set up an SSH alias so you can SSH into your server using just ssh testserver (hint: look at your SSH config). Create a local text file and SFTP it to the server. SSH in, edit the file, and SFTP it back. [Advanced] Stand up a nginx server on your remote instance. Don’t open the port to the world, but SSH port forward the server page to your local browser.
