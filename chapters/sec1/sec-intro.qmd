Section 1: Applying DevOps to Data Science

If you're a data scientist, how does DevOps apply to you? There are two main ways. The first is that you are probably responsible for a variety of different activities relating to developing your analyses and apps. Since data science is fundamentally a computational practice, you're going to need to use computers, and if you're going to production, you're probably using servers.

In the first section, you'll learn about patterns, tools, and processes that will make it easier for you to develop and deploy your code, even if you are never directly responsible for managing the underlying server infrastructure. This section should be useful for any data scientist who is putting work "into production".
