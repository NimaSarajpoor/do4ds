# Deployments and code promotion {#sec-deployments}

Your work doesn't matter if it never leaves your computer. You want your
work to be useful, and the only way to accomplish that is to share it
with the people and systems that matter. That requires putting it into
production.

When it goes well, putting code into production is a low-drama affair.
When it goes poorly, putting code into production is a time-consuming
ordeal. That's why the process of putting code into production --
*deployment* -- is one of the primary concerns of DevOps best practices.

The DevOps way to deploy code is called *CI/CD*, which is short for
Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment and Continuous Delivery
(yes, the CD stands for two different things). When implemented well,
CI/CD eases the deployment process through a combination of good
workflows and automation.

A few of the principles of CI/CD workflows include:

-   Central availability of source code, almost always in version
    control, that allows you to build the project from scratch.
-   Frequent and incremental additions to the production version of the
    code.
-   Automation for carrying out the actual deployment.
-   Automated testing on a pre-deployment version of the code.

In this chapter, you'll learn how to create a code promotion process
that allows you to incorporate CI/CD principles and tools into your data
science project deployments.

## Separate the prod environment

CI/CD is all about easily promoting code into production. If there's not
a clear boundary between what is in production and what isn't, it's all
too easy to mess up production. That's why software environments are
often separated into three: *dev*, *test*, and *prod*.

Dev is the development environment where new work is produced, test is
where the code is tested for performance, usability; and feature
completeness; and prod is the production environment. Sometimes dev and
test are collectively called the *lower environments* and prod the
*higher environment*.

![](images/dev-test-prod.png){fig-alt="An app moving through dev, test, and prod environments."
width="600"}

While the dev/test/prod triad is the most traditional, some
organizations have more than 2 lower environments and some organizations
just have a dev and prod. That's all fine. The number and configuration
of lower environments should vary according to your organization and its
needs. But, just as, Tolstoy said about happy families, all prod
environments are alike.

Some criteria that all good prod environments meet:

1.  The environment is created using code. For data science, that means
    managing R and Python packages using environments as code tooling,
    as discussed in [Chapter @sec-env-as-code].

2.  Changes happen via a promotion process. The process combines human
    approvals that the code is ready for production and automations to
    run tests and do the actual deployment.

3.  Changes **only** happen via the promotion process. This means no
    manual changes to the environment or the code that's active in
    production.

Rules 1 and 2 tend to be easy to follow. It might even be fun to figure
out how to create the environment with code and design a promotion
process. But the first time something breaks in your prod environment,
you will be sorely tempted to violate rule 3. Don't do it.

If you want to run a data science project that becomes critical to your
organization, keeping a pristine prod environment is nonnegotiable. When
an issue arises, you will need to reproduce it in a lower environment
before you can push changes through your promotion process. This means
that keeping your environments in sync is crucial so you can reliably
reproduce prod issues in lower environments.

These guidelines for a prod environment look almost identical to
guidelines for general purpose software engineering. It's in the
composition of lower environments that the needs of data scientists
diverge from general purpose software engineers.

### Dev and test environments

As a data scientist, dev means working in a lab environment like
RStudio, Spyder, VSCode, or PyCharm and experimenting with the data.
You're slicing the data this way or that to see if anything meaningful
emerges, creating plots to see if they are the right way to show off a
finding, and checking whether certain features improve model
performance. All this means that it is basically impossible to do work
without real data.

"Duh", you say, "Of course you can't do data science without real data."

This may be obvious to you, but needing to do data science on real data
in dev is a common source of friction with IT/Admins.

That's because this need is unique to data scientists. For general
purpose software engineering, a lower environment needs data that is
*formatted* like the real data, but the actual content doesn't matter.

For example, if you're building an online store, you need dev and test
environments where the API calls from the sales system are in the same
format as the real data, but you don't actually care if it's real sales
data. In fact, you probably want to create some odd-looking cases for
testing purposes.

One way to help allay concerns about using real data is to create a
*data science sandbox*. A great data science sandbox provides:

-   Read-only access to real data for experimentation.

-   Places to write mock data to test out things you'll write for real
    in prod.

-   Broad access to R and Python packages to experiment with before
    things go to prod.

Working with your IT/Admin team to get these things isn't always easy.
They might not want to give you real data in dev. One point to emphasize
is that creating this environment actually makes things more secure. It
gives you a place to do development without any fear that you might
actually damage production data or services.

## Version control implements code promotion

Once you've invented your code promotion process, you need a way to
operationalize it. If your process says that your code needs testing and
review before it's pushed to prod, you need a place to actually do that.
*Version control* is the tool to make your code promotion process real.

Version control is software that allows you to keep the prod version of
your code safe, gives contributors their own copy to work on, and hosts
tools to manage merging changes back together. These days, Git is the
industry standard for version control.

Git is an open source system for tracking changes to computer files in a
project-level collection called a *repository*. You can host
repositories on your own Git server, but most organizations host their
repositories with free or paid plans from tools like GitHub, GitLab,
Bitbucket, or Azure DevOps.

This is not a book on git. If you're not already comfortable with using
local and remote repositories, branching, and merging, then the rest of
this chapter is not going to be useful right now. I recommend you take a
break from this book and spend some time learning Git.

## Hints on learning Git

People who say learning Git is easy are either lying or have forgotten.
I am sorry our industry has standardized on a tool with such terrible
ergonomics, but it's worth your time to learn.

Whether you're an R or Python user, I'd recommend starting with a
resource designed to teach Git to a data science user. My recommendation
is to check out [HappyGitWithR](https://happygitwithr.com/) by Jenny
Bryan.

If you're a Python user, some of the specific tooling suggestions won't
apply, but the general principles will be exactly the same.

If you know Git and just need a reminder of some common commands, see
[Appendix @sec-append-cheat] for a cheatsheet of common ones.
:::

The precise contours of your code promotion process -- and therefore
your Git policies -- are up to you and your organization's needs. Do you
need multiple rounds of review? Can anyone promote something to prod or
just certain people? Is automated testing required?

You should make these decisions as part of your code promotion process,
which you can then enshrine in the configuration of your project's Git
repository.

One important decision you'll make is how to configure the branches of
your Git repository. Here's how I'd suggest you do it for production
data science projects:

1.  Maintain two long running branches -- `main` is the prod version of
    your project and `test` is a long-running pre-prod version.
2.  Code can only be promoted to `main` via a merge from `test`. Direct
    pushes to `main` are not allowed.
3.  New functionality is developed in short-lived *feature branches*
    that are merged into `test` when you think they're ready to go. Once
    sufficient approvals are granted, the feature branch changes in
    `test` are merged into `main`.

This framework helps maintain a reliable prod version on the `main`
branch, while also leaving sufficient flexibility to accomplish
basically any set of approvals and testing you might want.

Here's an example of how this might work. Let's say you were working on
a dashboard and were trying to add a new plot.

You would create a new feature branch with your work, perhaps called
`new_plot`. When you were happy with it, you would merge the feature
branch to `test`. Depending on your organization's process, you might be
able to merge to `test` yourself or you might require approval.

If your testing turned up a bug, you'd fix the bug in the feature
branch, merge the bug fix into `test`, re-test, and merge to `main` once
you were satisfied.

Here's what the Git graph for that sequence of events might look like:

![](images/git-branches.png){fig-alt="Diagram showing branching strategy. A feature branch called new plot is created from and then merged back to test. A bug is revealed, so another commit fixing the bug is merged into test and then into main."
width="600"}

One of the tenets of a good CI/CD practice is that changes are merged
frequently and incrementally into production.

A good rule of thumb is that you want your merges to be the smallest
meaningful change that can be incorporated into main in a standalone
way.

There are no hard and fast rules here. Knowing the appropriate scope for
a single merge is an art -- one that can take years to develop. Your
best resource here is more senior team members who've already figured it
out.

## CI/CD automates Git operations

The role of Git is to make your code promotion process happen. Git
allows you to configure requirements for whatever approvals and testing
you might need. Your CI/CD tool sits on top of that so that all this
merging and branching actually **does** something.[^1-5-deployments-1]

[^1-5-deployments-1]: Strictly speaking, this is not true. There are a
    lot of different ways to kick off CI/CD jobs. But the right way to
    do it is to base it on Git operations.

To be more precise, a *CI/CD pipeline* for a project watches the Git
repository and does something based on a trigger. Common triggers
include a push or merge to a particular branch or a pull request
opening.

The most common CI/CD operations are *pre-merge checks* like spell
checking, code linting, and automated testing and *post-merge
deployments*.

There are a variety of different CI/CD tools available. Because of the
tight linkage between CI/CD operations and Git repos, CI/CD pipelines
built right into Git providers are very popular.

GitHub Actions (GHA) was released a few years ago and is eating the
world of CI/CD. Depending on your organization and the age of your CI/CD
pipeline, you might also see Jenkins, Travis, Azure DevOps, or GitLab.

### Configuring per-environment behavior

As you promote an app from dev to test and prod, you probably want
behavior to look different across the environments. For example, you
might want to switch data sources from a dev database to a prod one, or
switch a read-only app into write mode, or use a different level of
logging.

The easiest way to create per-environment behavior is to:

1.  Write code that includes flags that change behavior (e.g. write to
    the database or no).
2.  Capture the intended behavior for each environment in a *YAML config
    file*.
3.  Read in the config file as your code starts.
4.  Choose the values for the current environment based on an
    environment variable.

::: callout-note
Only non-secret configuration settings should go in a config file.
Secrets should always be configured using secrets management tools so
they don't appear in plain text.

Most CI/CD tooling supports injecting secrets into the pipeline as
environment variables.
:::

For example, let's say you have a project that should use a special
read-only database in dev and switch to writing in the prod database in
prod. You might write the config file below to describe this behavior:

```{yaml filename="config.yml"}
dev:
  write: false
  db-path: dev-db
test
  write: true
prod:
  write: true
  db-path: prod-db
```

Then, you'd set that an environment variable to have the value `dev` in
dev, `test` in test, and `prod` in prod. Your code would grab the
correct set of values based on the environment variable.

In Python there are many different ways to set and read in your a
per-environment configuration. The easiest way to use YAML is just to
read it in with the `{yaml}` package and treat it as a dictionary.

In R, the `{config}` package is the standard way to load a configuration
from a YAML file. The `config::get()` function uses the value of the
`R_CONFIG_ACTIVE` environment variable to choose which configuration to
use.

4.  Write out a mental map of the relationship of the following terms:
    Git, GitHub, CI/CD, GitHub Actions, Version Control

## Lab 5: Host a website with automatic updates {#lab5}

In labs 1 through 4, you've created a Quarto website for the penguin
model. You've got sections on EDA and model building. But it's still
just on your computer.

In this lab, we're going to deploy that website to a public site on
GitHub and set up GitHub Actions as CI/CD so the EDA and modeling steps
re-render every time we make changes.

Before we get into the meat of the lab, there are a few things you need
to do on your own. If you don't know how, there are plenty of great
tutorials online.

1.  Create an empty public repo on GitHub.
2.  Configure the repo as the remote for your Quarto project directory.

Once you've got the GitHub repo connected to your project, you need to
set up the Quarto project to publish via GitHub Actions. There are great
directions on how to get that configured on the [Quarto
website](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html#github-action).

Following those instructions will accomplish three things for you:

1.  Generate a `_publish.yml`, which is a Quarto-specific file for
    configuring publishing locations.
2.  Configure GitHub Pages to serve your website off a long-running
    standalone branch called `gh-pages`.
3.  Generate a GitHub Actions workflow file, which will live at
    `.github/workflows/publish.yml`.

Here's the basic GitHub Actions file (or close to it) that the process
will auto-generate for you.

``` {.yaml include="../../_labs/gha/publish-basic.yml" filename=".github/workflows/publish.yml"}
```

This action, like all GitHub Actions, is defined in a `.yml` file in the
`.github/workflows` directory of a project. It contains several
sections:

-   The `on` section defines **when** the workflow occurs. In this case,
    we've configured the workflow only to trigger on a push to the
    `main` branch.[^1-5-deployments-2] Another common case would be to
    trigger on a pull request to `main` or another branch.
-   The `jobs` section defines **what** happens in `steps`, which occur
    in sequential order.
    -   The `runs-on` field specifies which *runner* to use. A runner is
        a virtual machine that is started from scratch every time the
        action runs. GitHub Actions offers runners with Ubuntu, Windows,
        and MacOS. You can also add custom runners.
    -   Most steps are defined with `uses`, which calls a preexisting
        GitHub Actions step that someone else has written.
    -   You can inject variables using `with` and environment variables
        using `env`.

[^1-5-deployments-2]: A completed merge counts as a push.

Now, if you try to run this, it probably won't work.

That's because the CI/CD process occurs in a completely isolated
environment. This auto-generated action doesn't include setting up
versions of R and Python or the packages to run our EDA and modeling
scripts. We need to get that configured before this action will work.

::: callout-note
If you read the Quarto documentation, they recommend freezing your
computations. Freezing is very useful if you want to render your R or
Python code only once and just update the text of your document. You
wouldn't need to set up R or Python in CI/CD and the document would
render faster.

That said, freezing isn't an option if you intend the R or Python code
to re-run because it's a job you care about.

Because the main point here is to learn about getting environments as
code working in CI/CD you **should not** freeze your environment.
:::

First, add the commands to install R, `{renv}`, and the packages for
your content to the GitHub Actions workflow.

``` {.yml filename=".github/workflows/publish.yml" include="../../_labs/gha/publish-r-py.yml" start-line="20" end-line="31"}
```

::: callout-note
If you're having slow package installs in CI/CD for R, I'd strongly
recommend using a repos override like in the example above.

The issue is that CRAN doesn't serve binary packages for Linux, which
means slow installs. You need to direct `{renv}` to install from Public
Posit Package Manager, which does have Linux binaries.
:::

You'll also need to add a workflow to GitHub Actions to install Python
and the necessary Python packages from the `requirements.txt`.

``` {.yml filename=".github/workflows/publish.yml" include="../../_labs/gha/publish-r-py.yml" start-line="33" end-line="39"}
```

Note that in this case, we run the Python environment restore commands
with `run` rather than `uses`. Where `uses` takes an existing GitHub
Action and runs it, `run` just runs the shell command natively.

Once you've made those changes, try pushing or merging your project to
`main`. If you click on the `Actions` tab on GitHub you'll be able to
see the Action running.

In all honesty, it will probably fail the first time or five. You will
almost never get your Actions correct on the first try. Just breathe
deeply and know we've all been there. You'll figure it out.

Once it's up, your website will be available at
`https://<username>.github.io/<repo-name>`.
