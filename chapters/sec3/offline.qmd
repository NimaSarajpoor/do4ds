Some organizations require that servers not be connected to the internet (airgapped/offline)

This makes things hard.

Understanding whether it's inbound connections that are disallowed or both outbound + inbound is important.

Difficulties that tend to arise:

-   Downloading software updates
-   Getting R/Python packages
-   Software licensing (often reach to license servers)
