# Tools of the Trade  {#sec-tools}

As you get deeper into DevOps territory, you'll find that there are a
few tools that you need to be familiar with. This section is designed to
help you get up and running with the most common tools of the IT/Admin.

This section will give you an intro to using the terminal on your
machine, using SSH to connect to a remote server, and basic operations
using the command line.

It may be the case you're already comfortable with these tools and you
can entirely skip this section -- I'd recommend reviewing the questions
at the end of each chapter to see if you can safely skip that chapter.
