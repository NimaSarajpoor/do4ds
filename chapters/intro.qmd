# Introduction {.unnumbered}

At some point, most data scientists reach the point where they want to show their work to others. But the skills and tools to deploy data science are completely different from the skills and tools needed to do data science.

\> If you're a data scientist who wants to get your work in front of the right people, this book aims to equip you with \*\*all the technical things you need to know that aren't data science.\*\*

Hopefully, once you've read this book, you'll understand how to deploy your data science, whether you're building a DIY deployment system or trying to work with your organization's IT/DevOps/SysAdmin/SRE group to make that happen.

## Moving Data Science to A Server

In recent years, as data science has become more central to organizations, many have been moving their operations off of individual contributors' laptops and onto centralized servers. Depending on your organization, the centralization of data science operations can make your life way easier -- or it can be kinda a bummer.

Server migrations can work well regardless of whether they're instigated by the data science or the IT organization. The biggest determinant is how well the data science and IT/DevOps teams can collaborate.

Data scientists are good at manipulating and using data, but most have little expertise in SysAdmin work, and aren't really that interested. On the flip side, IT/DevOps organizations usually don't really understand data science workflows, the data science development process, or how data scientists use R and Python.

Often, migrations to a server are instigated by the data scientists themselves -- usually because they've run out of horsepower on their laptops. If you, or one of your teammates, enjoys and is good as SysAdmin work, this can be a great situation! You get the hardware you need for your project quickly and with minimal interference.

On the other hand, most data scientists don't really want to be SysAdmins, and these systems are often fragile, isolated from other corporate systems, and potentially susceptible to security vulnerabilities.

Other organizations are moving to servers as well, but led by the IT group. For many IT groups, it's way easier to maintain a centralized server environment, as opposed to helping each data scientist maintain their own environment on their laptop.

Having just one platform makes it much easier to give shared access to more powerful computing platforms, to data sources that require some configuration, and to R and Python packages that wrap around system libraries and can be a pain to configure (looking at you, rJava).

This can be a great situation for data scientists! If the platform is well-configured and scoped, you can get instant access through their web browser to more compute resources, and don't have to worry about maintaining local installations of data science tools like R, Python, RStudio, and Jupyter, and you don't need to worry about how to connect to important data sources -- those things are just available for use.

But this can also be a bad experience. Long wait times for hardware or software updates, overly restrictive policies -- especially around package management -- and misunderstandings of what data scientists are trying to do on the platforms can lead to servers going largely unused.

So much of whether the server-based experience is good or not depends on the relationship between the data science and IT/Admin group. In organizations where these groups work together smoothly, this can be a huge win for everyone involved. However, there are some organizations where IT/Admins are so concerned with stability and security that they make it impossible to do data science, and the data scientists spend all their time playing cat-and-mouse games to try to get work done behind IT/Admin's backs.

If you work at such a place, it's frankly hard to get much done on the server. It's probably worth investing some time into improving your relationship with your favorite person on the IT/Admin team. Hopefully, this book will help you understand a little of what's on the minds of people in the IT group, and a sense of how to talk to them better.

## Intro (reprise -- to edit)

Much data science takes place on the laptops of data scientists the world over.

However, workloads are increasingly outgrowing the capacity of laptops, data science apps and assets are becoming more and more mission-critical, and organizations are centralizing their data science functions. As a result, more and more data science is taking place in ways that interact with tools and systems traditionally within the domain of the IT group.

Sometimes this group is called DevOps, and increasingly there are standalone groups for MLOps or DataOps.

In some organizations, the DevOps group wants to support data scientists, but may not be sure how. In other organizations, data scientists are on their own to figure out how to operate.

I lead the Solutions Engineering team at RStudio. My team sits exactly in this odd space in between the data scientists and the IT/Admin/DevOps organization. We constantly sit on calls to help the IT/Admin group understand what the data scientists need and help the data scientists ask the right questions of the IT/Admin team.

This book is split into three parts.

Part one is about tools and strategies DevOps professionals know all about that data scientists might want to use in their everyday work as they "go to production". This will include topics like developing and testing apps as they go, using CI/CD to deploy, and more.

Part two is for data scientists who might have to set up their own server-based data science workbenches, and will provide both conceptual understanding and hands-on knowledge of how to set up your own data science workbench.

The final part is for people who have the support of a DevOps/IT/Admin function at their organization, but don't know how to communicate. These are tools and technologies that are commonplace at many large organizations -- and are probably totally foreign to most data scientists. The second half of this book is less hands-on. I don't expect many readers of this book to be setting up their own LDAP server for authentication or setting up a high-availability cluster of servers.

But you might have to collaborate with your organization's IT/Admin group on such things. If you do, hopefully this book will help you understand the important questions to ask, the things you need to explain, and maybe make that relationship a little easier to manage.
