# Servers and the Cloud

## What is a Server?
* Computer that lives somewhere else
* Just the computer itself
* Usually don't have access to it the way you do to local machine
* Usually login to access the command line on that machine using [SSH](#ssh)
* Purpose is to serve things -- to other machines via APIs or people via browser

## What does networking mean?
* How you know where to access a server
* Lots of layers, but controls access to the servers doors
* Different from authentication, which determines who gets let into doors
  
## How is a server different from my laptop? [maybe make a table?]
* OS
* How you access
* Server software (NGINX)

## How can I get my very own server?
* Cloud free tiers
* Walk through creating account, logging in, getting EC2 set up
* Access using PEM key (point to SSH chapter)
* Set up NGINX

## Exercises:
1. Consider a simple data science app that allows an end user to view data. Can
you draw a diagram of how that app could be deployed on remote servers? Where 
could the data live? How would users access the app? How would you access the 
app to do maintenance?
2. Try standing up your own server in one of the major cloud providers and 
accessing it using the provided .pem key.
