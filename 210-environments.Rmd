# Environments and Reproducibility

Learning Objectives:

* Understand the layers that go into reproducing an output
* Understand which part is "the environment"
* Understand some general strategies/tooling for reproducing

---

* Managing environments is hard. 
  * Necessary in data science primarily for repro.
  
* At least 7 levels:
  * Hardware
  * Operating System
  * System Libraries
  * Programming Language
  * Packages
  * App Code
  * App Data

-> Difference between environment and data is sketchy

All of it contributes to "state"

Different requirements depending on if you're talking about development (IDE) environment or production environment.

* Repository vs library mgmt

Tools to Reproduce Parts of Stack:

* IaC tooling
  * Provisioning
  * Configuration mgmt
* AMIs
* virtualenv/conda/renv
* Docker/Containers
