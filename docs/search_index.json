Generation of insights or applications to provide insights based on data. Data Science vs BI vs Analytics – it’s all fuzzy Data Visualization and Machine Learning are a means, not an ends. Role in org varies widely – and therefore IT requirements are hard to predict. As data science becomes more central to org’s value generation, data science is increasingly being done in centralized platforms. What is the open data science platform: A centralized location to manage data science dev environment, as well as test and deploy content to end-users. Comparison to decentralized “work on your own machine” situations. Components Workbench Package Management Change Control (git) Deployment Environment Front End vs Back End Data Ingest/Access Determining Requirements for your platform Platform requirements combination of Work being done on the platform Data Science needs (i.e. horsepower) Existing state of org’s data Type of work data scientists might do Batch Jobs ETL Reports Data Generation Real-Time Interactive Models APIs Apps Data Science + IT Needs Languages (R, Python, SQL) Sharing – internal, external Online or offline?

Computer that lives somewhere else Just the computer itself Usually don’t have access to it the way you do to local machine Usually login to access the command line on that machine using SSH Purpose is to serve things – to other machines via APIs or people via browser [Diagram: 3 ways of accessing servers] 2.2 What is the Cloud? General description for servers that you rent instead of buy 3 major cloud providers Services: Compute Storage Database Networking MANY MANY MANY layers on top of that 2.3 What does networking mean? How you know where to access a server Lots of layers, but controls access to the servers doors Different from authentication, which determines who gets let into doors 2.4 How is a server different from my laptop? [maybe make a table?] OS How you access Server software (NGINX) 2.5 How can I get my very own server? Cloud free tiers Walk through creating account, logging in, getting EC2 set up Access using PEM key (point to SSH chapter) Set up NGINX 2.6 Exercises: Consider a simple data science app that allows an end user to view data. Can you draw a diagram of how that app could be deployed on remote servers? Where could the data live? How would users access the app? How would you access the app to do maintenance?

[Diagram: Packet Routing] The internet uses a set of protocols collectively known as TCP/IP – they define how networked computers create and address packets, and then how those packets are sent, routed, and received. When a computer joins a network, it gets an Internet Protocol (IP) address V4 vs V6 IP addresses are split up into “blocks” – some reserved for particular uses Routing generally occurs via DNS – centralized servers that transform the usual human-friendly URLs we know into IP addresses. Public IP addresses are paid – you’ll get one with your EC2 instance 3.1.2 What happens once they find each other? [Diagram: HTTP Request] An “application layer” protocol kicks in. This is a protocol for sending actual content from one computer to another. For example, HTTP defines a client/server relationship where the client (your web browser) makes requests that the server fulfills. Other protocols: e.g. websockets Whether you are allowed to access a particular resource is about Authentication and Authorization "],["networking-for-your-data-science-servers.html", "Chapter 4 Networking for your data science servers 4.1 Network Topology 4.2 I’ve heard HTTPS is a thing 4.3 Exercises", " Chapter 4 Networking for your data science servers 4.1 Network Topology [Diagram: Common Network Topology] Most work occurs inside a VPC IP addresses inside a VPC can be assigned as you wish Subject to CIDR block rules Need translation between inside and outside -&gt; proxy If being used for SSH access, usually called bastion Proxies commonly used to serve as firewalls, network address translators, load-balancers Forward (outbound) proxy vs reverse (inbound) proxy Private vs public subnets Particular ports being “open” 4.2 I’ve heard HTTPS is a thing Secured HTTP End-to-end encryption using Transport Layer Security (TLS) or Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) HTTP over TLS/SSL Getting and configuring an SSL certificate 4.3 Exercises Consider going to the website google.com.

Generate a new SSH key locally and copy the correct key onto the server (think for a moment about which key is the correct one – consult your diagram from step 1 if necessary). Set up an SSH alias so you can SSH into your server using just ssh testserver (hint: look at your SSH config). Create a local text file and SFTP it to the server.
