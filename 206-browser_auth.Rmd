# Accessing Servers via Browser/HTTP {#auth}

## How auth works
1) Check who you are - Authentication
2) Check whether you should have access - Authorization
 
Differences between auth types
1) How is the communication done? Transmit text vs token (type/encryption)
2) When is the identity checked? Once, every time
3) When is authorization checked? 
4) How encrypted are things?
